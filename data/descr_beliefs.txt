;; JNF 2021-07-27 - Okay, I TRIED to make this compatable with the old definition style, but there's absolutely no way to verify the format so if things were wrong you'd get a
;;                  whole bunch of "settlement '' not found in stringtable" errors because the region DB also has zero verification and since the last line of the settlement has
;;                  "pagan" in it instead of "data/ui/pips/pip_religion_pagan_positive.tga", which would be the name of the religion because you're missing a line so it overflows,
;;                  and so the format, stupidly, just assumes because the line isn't a valid religion it must, in fact, be the start of another settlement definition. Idiotic.
;;                  Anyway, that's why you have to rewrite this, modders. Have fun!
